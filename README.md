# Python MQTT Publisher and Subscriber

This repository contains two Python scripts that demonstrate the basic operations of MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) publishers and subscribers using the Paho MQTT client library.

## publisher.py

This script is a simple MQTT publisher that connects to a local MQTT broker, publishes messages to two topics, and subscribes to all topics of interest. You can use this script to test the MQTT broker and the subscriber code.

### Key Functions

- `on_connect`: Called when the client connects to the MQTT broker. It subscribes to all topics of interest upon connecting.
- `on_message`: Called when a message is received from the MQTT broker.
- `publish_messages`: Publishes messages to the MQTT broker.

## subscriber.py

This script demonstrates an MQTT subscriber that connects to a broker and subscribes to specific topics. It uses the Paho MQTT client library to establish the MQTT connection and handle incoming messages. The code announces the subscriber's status and subscribes to two topics: "messages/general" and "device/{subscriber_id}".

### Key Functions

- `on_connect`: Called when the client receives a CONNACK response from the server. It publishes an "online" message and subscribes to the topics.
- `on_message`: Called when a PUBLISH message is received from the server.
- `on_disconnect`: Handles disconnection events.

## Installation

Install the Paho MQTT client library using pip:

```
pip3 install paho-mqtt
```

## Usage

To run these scripts, you need to have a running MQTT broker. You can use publicly available brokers or run your own. Once you have a broker running, you can run the scripts as follows:

```
python3 publisher.py
python3 subscriber.py
```

## Broker Installation

To run these scripts, you need to have a running MQTT broker. You can use publicly available brokers or run your own.

If you want to run your own broker, you can use Mosquitto, a popular MQTT broker. Here's how to install it on a Mac:

```
brew install mosquitto
```

After installation, start the broker as a background service with:

```
brew services start mosquitto
```

## Broker Configuration

After installing the Mosquitto broker, configure it by adding a listener on port 1883 and allowing anonymous connections. Edit the `mosquitto.conf` file to add these configurations.

On a Mac, edit the file with:

```
nano /opt/homebrew/etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```

On a Raspberry Pi, edit the file with:

```
sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
```

Add the following configurations:

```
listener 1883
allow_anonymous true
log_type all
```

These settings start a listener on port 1883, allow anonymous connections, and log all types of information.
